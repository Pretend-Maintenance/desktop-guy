# Desktop Guy

A tiny pixel-art companion that sits on your Windows desktop, wanders around
now and then, says the occasional thing, and dozes off if you step away from
the keyboard for a while. Built as a template so more characters can be
dropped in without touching any code.

## Running it

Requires the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) with the
"Desktop development with .NET" (WPF) workload, on Windows.

```
dotnet run --project src/DesktopGuy.App
```

By default it loads the first character it finds under
`src/DesktopGuy.App/Assets/Characters`. To pick a specific one:

```
dotnet run --project src/DesktopGuy.App -- --character Blob
```

Right-click the character for a small menu (say hi / exit) - there's no
taskbar icon or window border, so that's also how you close it.

## How it behaves

- **Idle & sleep**: if you don't touch the mouse or keyboard *anywhere on
  the system* for `idleTimeoutSeconds` (see character.json), the character
  curls up and snoozes with a little Zzz. Touch anything and it wakes back up.
- **Wandering**: every so often (a random interval between
  `walkIntervalMinSeconds` and `walkIntervalMaxSeconds`) it walks a short
  distance left or right along the bottom of the screen.
- **Speech bubbles**: at random intervals it pops up a little speech bubble
  with a line picked from `phrases` in its character.json.
- **Drag**: click and hold to pick it up and move it anywhere; if you drop it
  above the ground it gently falls back down.

## Project layout

```
src/DesktopGuy.App/
  Engine/               <- character-agnostic behavior engine (state machine,
                            idle detection, sprite animation, window plumbing)
  Characters/            <- CharacterDefinition model + loader for character.json
  Assets/Characters/
    Blob/                <- the default (placeholder) character
      character.json
      spritesheet.png
  MainWindow.xaml(.cs)    <- the transparent always-on-top overlay window
```

The `Engine` and `Characters` code never mentions "Blob" or any specific
character - everything character-specific lives in `character.json` and the
sprite sheet, which is how new characters get added.

## Adding a new character

1. Make a new folder under `Assets/Characters/<YourCharacterName>/`.
2. Add a sprite sheet PNG. Frames are laid out in a grid: one **row per
   animation**, frames left-to-right within a row, all frames the same
   pixel size. You need (at least) these five animations: `idle`, `walk`,
   `sleep`, `drag`, `wake`.
3. Add a `character.json` next to it (copy `Blob/character.json` as a
   starting point) describing:
   - `frameSize`: pixel width/height of a single frame in the sheet
   - `scale`: how many times to scale the sprite up on screen (pixel art
     usually wants 3-6x so it isn't tiny)
   - `animations`: for each animation name, which sprite-sheet `row` it's
     on, how many frames (`frameCount`), how fast to play them (`fps`),
     and whether it `loop`s (only `wake` is usually non-looping - it plays
     once, then the character goes back to `idle`)
   - `behavior`: idle timeout, wander timing, speech timing
   - `phrases`: the lines it can say
4. In the `.csproj`, files under `Assets/Characters/**` are already
   configured to copy to the output folder automatically - no project file
   changes needed.
5. Run it with `dotnet run --project src/DesktopGuy.App -- --character
   YourCharacterName`.

## About the placeholder art

`Blob`'s sprite sheet is simple generated pixel-art blocks, good enough to
see the whole system working end-to-end (idle blink, walk bounce, sleep
Zzz, wide-eyed drag, wake-up blink) but it's meant to be swapped out - drop
in real pixel-art sprite sheets for `Blob` or any new character and nothing
else needs to change.
